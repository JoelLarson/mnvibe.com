  Fundraisers are conducted for eight major charities, including kidney, heart, diabetes, cancer
  and spinal cord injury funds, a children's fund, memorial foundation and the Golden Eagle Fund.

  ## Our History

  The F.O.E. was founded in February, 1898 by six theatre owners gathered
  in a Seattle shipyard to discuss a musician's strike. After addressing the matter,
  they agreed to "bury the hatchet" and form "The Order of Good Things."
  As numbers grew, members selected the Bald Eagle as the official emblem
  and changed the name to "The Fraternal Order of Eagles."
  The women's auxiliary traces its roots to 1927.
  The Fraternal Order of Eagles includes nearly 800,000 members
  and more than 1,500 locations across the United States and Canada.
